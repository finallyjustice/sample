To build libvirt-6.3.0 on Oracle Linux 7


This is about how I build libvirt-6.3.0 on Oracle Linux in order to diagnose libvirt issue.

Please do not 'su' or 'sudo', unless they are explicitly suggested. By default, all commands are with 'user' privilege.

1. Create "/soft" and change permission to user.

$ sudo mkdir /soft
$ sudo chown zhang:zhang /soft


2. To build libvirt.

$ cd libvirt-6.3.0
$ mkdir build
$ ../configure --prefix=/soft/libvirt --with-dtrace=no --enable-debug

Please install prerequisite packages reported by 'configure'.

$ make -j24 > /dev/null
$ make install

The libvirt will be installed to "/soft/libvirt"


3. Please switch to 'su'.

$ su
#


4. To confirm the 'kvm' capability is available. (It is interesting that I do not see 'kvm' capability on VM as hypervisor).

# /soft/libvirt/bin/virsh capabilities | grep kvm
      <baselabel type='kvm'>+0:+0</baselabel>
      <domain type='kvm'/>
      <domain type='kvm'/>


5. Please open 3 bash sessions. The 1st is for 'virtlogd'. The 2nd is for 'libvirtd'. The 3rd is for 'virsh'.

(1) To start 'virtlogd':

# /soft/libvirt/sbin/virtlogd -v

(2) To start 'libvirtd':

# /soft/libvirt/sbin/libvirtd -v


6. This is to create a VM.

# /soft/libvirt/bin/virsh create vm.xml

# /soft/libvirt/bin/virsh list
 Id   Name          State
